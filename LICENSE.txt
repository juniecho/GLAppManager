III. TERMS OF MODIFICATION OR REPRODUCTION (APPLIED TO THIRD PARTY DEVELOPERS)

1. Grant of Copyright License to Modify or Reproduce
Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, GomdoLight Developer or Third Party Developer hereby grants to you a worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free copyright license to ‘modify’ or ‘reproduce’ GomdoLight Products or Derivative Works.

2. Personal Modification or Reproduction
As long as you do not distribute your Derivative Work(s) to the public, the restrictions in subsection 4 through 7 do not apply.

3. Commercial Use
Your Derivative Work must not be commercially sold.

4. Title of Derivative Works
The title (name) of your Derivative Work may not contain the word “GomdoLight”, or any words that are intentionally composed similarly to it with the purpose to give a false impression to the public that the Derivative Work is released from, or under the supervision of the GomdoLight Developer.

5. Reference to the Original GomdoLight Products
Your Derivative Work must carry prominent notices stating that it is wholly or partly based on GomdoLight Products, and giving a relevant date. Also, you must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files. All notice must be in human-readable format and must be placed within the documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, that is easily accessible for the end user.

6. Licensing Your Derivative Works
Your Derivative Work, excluding Third Party Components, should be licensed under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable additional terms, to your Derivative Work and all its parts (excluding Third Party Components). This License gives no permission to license the Derivative Work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it from the GomdoLight Developer.

7. License Notice in Your Derivative Works
Any Derivative Works must include a readable copy of this License in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, that is easily accessible for the end user. You may add your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that you distribute, alongside or as an addendum to this License, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying this License.

IV. TERMS OF DISTRIBUTION

1. For Unmodified GomdoLight Products
You may NOT distribute unmodified (original) copies of the GomdoLight Product to the general public without explicit consent from the Developer.

2. For Derivative Works
You may distribute your Derivative Work in any medium, only when the source code and other resources you added or modified, and all relevant information required to reproduce your Derivative Work is also distributed publicly. However, those source, resources, and information can be published separately from the Derivative Work itself, as long as they are easily accessible for the general public.

V. TERMINATION

You may not download, install, use, modify, or reproduce GomdoLight Products and/or Derivative Works, or distribute Derivative Works except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, if you cease all violation of this License then your license is reinstated unless the GomdoLight Developer or Third Party Developer explicitly and finally terminates your license. Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License.
